##OVERVIEW
To use this app you will need:
- An Arduino Uno
- a BMP280 Adafruit sensor
- A OTG cable that can connect said Arduino Uno to your Android device

To use this app:
1. Hook up the BMP280 sensor to the Arduino, as detailed [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-bmp280-barometric-pressure-plus-temperature-sensor-breakout)
2. Run the code found in `bmp280_csv` of [this](https://github.com/hcwinsemius/elevation-barometry/tree/master/sketch) repo
3. Plug the Arduino into the OTG port of your android device (like a charging cable)
4. A popup should display asking if you wish to open the app. Say yes.
5. Start recording by pressing the `Start Arduino` button. Location updates will start simultaneously, and will be saved alongside the arduino readings.
